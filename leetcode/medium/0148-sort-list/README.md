# Sort List

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

Given the `head` of a linked list, return  *the list after sorting it in  **ascending order***.

 

 **Example 1:** 

```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]

```

 **Example 2:** 

```
Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]

```

 **Example 3:** 

```
Input: head = []
Output: []

```

 

 **Constraints:** 

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 104].
- -105 <= Node.val <= 105

 

 **Follow up:**  Can you sort the linked list in `O(n logn)` time and `O(1)` memory (i.e. constant space)?

```py
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head

        slow = head
        fast = head
        prev = None

        while fast and fast.next:
            prev = slow
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        prev.next = None

        left = self.sortList(head)
        right = self.sortList(slow)

        return self.merge(left, right)

    def merge(self, left, right):
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        curr = dummy

        while left and right:
            if left.val <= right.val:
                curr.next = left
                left = left.next
            else:
                curr.next = right
                right = right.next

            curr = curr.next

        curr.next = left if left else right

        return dummy.next
```
